# Grade parser from LMS to Announcement Page

This is a script which takes in LMS output (which can be csv file) then calculate weighted average and give letter grades. After that it takes in the list of students from announcement page merges the letter, midterm and final grades and saves in xls! (what year is this 1998?). Note that this is totally unnecessary, you can just do everything manually but it sucks and I was bored to death grading 180 students. So why not?
