# Grade parser from LMS to Announcement Page

This is a script that takes in LMS output (which can be a CSV file), then calculates the weighted average and assigns letter grades. After that, it takes in the list of students from the announcement page, merges the letter, midterm, and final grades, and saves it in an XLS file! (What year is thisâ€”1998?) Note that this is totally unnecessary; you could just do everything manually, but it sucks, and I was bored to death grading 180 students. So why not?
